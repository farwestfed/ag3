# ASA(IE&E) Weather Event Dashboard

## Overview
This dashboard provides decision support for infrastructure investment decisions at US Army bases, based on historical weather damage data. It visualizes weather-related damages and costs to help prioritize infrastructure investments and mitigation strategies.

## Features
- Interactive dashboard showing weather damage costs across Army installations
- Comprehensive data analysis through multiple views:
  - Damage Forecast
  - Event Analysis
  - Geographic Analysis
  - Budget Planning & Mitigation Strategy

### Key Visualizations
- Cost distribution by weather event type (pie chart)
- Top weather events by cost impact (horizontal bar chart)
- Geographic distribution of damages (map visualization)
- Scenario modeling for mitigation strategies
- Cost-benefit analysis for infrastructure improvements

### Budget Planning Features
- Interactive mitigation scenario modeling
- Real-time cost-benefit analysis
- ROI calculations for different mitigation strategies
- Implementation cost tracking
- Projected damage reduction estimates

## Data
The dashboard uses historical weather damage data stored in CSV format (`ag3_data_v7.csv`), which includes:
- Weather event details
- Damage costs
- Installation locations
- Event dates and types
